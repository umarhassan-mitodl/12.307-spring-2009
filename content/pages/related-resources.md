MIT course [12.003: Physics of Atmospheres and Oceans](/courses/12-003-atmosphere-ocean-and-climate-dynamics-fall-2008): This undergraduate class is designed to introduce students to the physics that govern the circulation of the ocean and atmosphere. The class includes rotating tank experiments, which offer the possibility of using a controlled laboratory environment to plan an experiment, explain ideas to be tested, observe and record the data.

Program in Atmospheres, Oceans and Climate ([PAOC](http://paocweb.mit.edu/)): The program oversees a broad program of education and research in the Department of Earth, Atmospheric and Planetary Sciences at MIT. Many of the most important discoveries in our science, such as chaos, the chemistry of the ozone hole and the physics of hurricanes were made by PAOC scientists.

[Synoptic Lab](http://paocweb.mit.edu/research-group/the-synoptic-lab): This site was developed for the teaching of undergraduate and graduate courses in Atmospheric Sciences at MIT. It provides access to real-time meteorological observations, analyses and forecasts, and specialized custom diagnostics.

Weather in a Tank ([Labguide](http://weathertank.mit.edu/)): The "Weather in a Tank" Web site, is an NSF-funded project in which curricular materials that combine atmospheric data and laboratory fluid experiments are being developed in the teaching of meteorology, oceanography and climate at the undergraduate level.
